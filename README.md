# Scrabble
c++ using Sdl2 libraries

This is just a new project i am working on.
Code could be improved, no questions, but i am doing it for fun.
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated though (maxime.p.jolly@gmail.com)

I am trying to make it as much realistic as possible so the final release should be close to the Scrabble board game.

All the pictures were made by me with Gimp.

I might make it avaible for smartphones, keeping it c++ and using Necessitas once i will get a decent release.
